for vgg_cnn_s I want a train_val.prototxt

deploy is used for generating predictions, train_val can be used for both (train and validation)

comparing for alexnet
  deploy:
    no data layers?
    no layer params for training:
      lr_mult
      decay_mult
      weight_filler
      bias_filler
    last layer is Softmax instead of SoftmaxWithLoss
    no accuracy layer
